<p>In addition to these traditional tactics, Islamic armies have also adapted to incorporate modern military technologies and strategies. In recent times, Islamic military forces have made use of advanced weapons, communication systems, and tactics to enhance their effectiveness on the battlefield. This combination of traditional and modern tactics has allowed Islamic armies to remain competitive and effective in a rapidly changing military landscape.</p>
<p>Overall, the impact of Islamic military tactics has been significant throughout history, shaping the way in which Islamic armies have fought and achieved success on the battlefield.
